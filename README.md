# Praxis-III
## Repository for Praxis III Project
This repository contains code for Team 0101A, working on the *Making Healthcare Accessible* opportunity for ESC203.

# Code Organization
Code it split into the three folders, representative of the three aspects of the design:
1. Slide Preparation
2. Slide Movement
3. Slide Analysis

# Slide Preparation
The slide preparation folder contains code that operates the fluidic system of the design. Its main purpose is to dry, stain, and flush the slides.

# Slide Movement
The slide movement folder contains code that operates the two-axis movement system. Its main purpose is to precisely move the slide around so that a camera—attached to a microscope—can take 100 **unique** photos of **different** portions of a 1 cm x 1 cm square on the slide.

# Slide Analysis
The slide analysis folder contains code that calculus the density of malaria parasites. Its main purpose is to use an existing maachine learning based malaria detection model to identify parasites, so that they can be tallied for a density calculation.
